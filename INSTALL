Thank you for downloading the Silverstripe Dashboard module.

Currently maintained by Mo and loosley based on the Dashboard Todo Prototype by Grayzag.

Install Instructions:
 1) Upload the Silverstripe Dashboard module to the "dashboard" folder in your
    SilverStripe root folder
 2) Run dev/build?flush=1
 3) Login to your administration panel - hopefully it works!
 
 ** Silverstripe navigator **
 The standard silverstripe navigator will most likely not work properly. In order to get it working,
 change the $Silverstripenavigator variable in your template to $SSNavigator
